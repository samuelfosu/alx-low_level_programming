#FILE I/O
Imagine your computer is like a big filing cabinet where it stores all kinds of information. Each file is like a piece of paper with something written on it, like a story, a picture, or some data.

Now, when we talk about "0x15-file_io," we're using a special language that tells the computer how to handle files. The "0x15" part might look weird, but it's just a way computers talk to each other using numbers and letters.

"File I/O" stands for "File Input/Output." Think of it like taking stuff in and out of those files in the computer's filing cabinet. So when we say "0x15-file_io," we're talking about a specific way of managing files, like opening them up, reading what's inside, writing new things in them, or closing them when we're done.

It's like having a set of instructions for your computer to follow whenever it needs to deal with files, like how you might have a set of rules for organizing your schoolwork in different folders.
