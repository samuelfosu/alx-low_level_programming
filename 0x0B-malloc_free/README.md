In the C programming language, malloc and free are two fundamental functions for memory allocation and deallocation, respectively. These functions are used for dynamic memory management, which allows you to allocate and release memory during the execution of your program

# malloc (Memory Allocation):

malloc stands for "memory allocation." It is a function that is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap, which is a region of memory separate from the stack where variables with a longer lifetime can be stored

size is the number of bytes you want to allocate.
The function returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block. The pointer has the type void*, so you will need to cast it to the appropriate data type before using it.


# free (Memory Deallocation):

free is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated with malloc or other memory allocation functions.

ptr is the pointer to the memory block you want to deallocate.
After you are done using the dynamically allocated memory, you should call free to release the memory back to the system. Failing to do so can lead to memory leaks, which can result in your program using more and more memory over time without releasing it.

It's important to note that after calling free, the memory pointed to by ptr is no longer valid, and attempting to access it can lead to undefined behavior.
