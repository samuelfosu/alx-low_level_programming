#Singly Linked List

Imagine you have a chain of toy cars lined up one after the other. Each car is connected to the next one by a hook or a string, and they form a line. This chain of cars is a bit like a singly linked list in programming.

In a singly linked list, we have a bunch of "boxes" or "nodes." Each box has two parts: one part holds some information (like a number or a name), and the other part points to the next box in the list. This way, they are connected like the cars in our toy car chain.

So, if you want to find a specific box in the list, you start at the first box and follow the pointers until you reach the box you're looking for. Each box only knows about the one that comes after it.

Here's an example in simple terms:

Box 1:

Information: 10
Pointer: Points to Box 2
Box 2:

Information: 23
Pointer: Points to Box 3
Box 3:

Information: 7
Pointer: Points to Box 4
... and so on.

The linked list starts with the first box, and you can follow the pointers to go from one box to the next.

Now, imagine you want to add a new box between Box 2 and Box 3. You would make the pointer in Box 2 point to the new box, and the new box's pointer would point to Box 3. It's like inserting a new car in our toy car chain.

If you remove a box, you just update the pointer in the previous box to skip the removed one, just like taking a car out of the chain.

Singly linked lists are a simple but powerful way for computers to organize and manage data. They are like a chain of information, where each piece of data points to the next one.
