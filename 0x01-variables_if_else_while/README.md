#1. Variables:

In C, a variable is like a container that can hold different types of information, such as numbers, text, or true/false values.
You can think of a variable as a labeled box where you can store and retrieve data.
For example, you can create a variable called score to store your test score like this: int score = 85;

#2. if Statements:

An if statement is like a decision-making tool. It helps your program make choices.
Imagine you want to tell your program to do something only if a condition is true. For instance, "If it's raining, take an umbrella."

#3. else Statements:

Sometimes, you want to do one thing if a condition is true and another thing if it's false.
For example, "If it's raining, take an umbrella; otherwise, don't."

#4. while Loops:

A while loop is like a repeating task. It allows you to do something over and over as long as a condition remains true.
Imagine you want to count from 1 to 10. Instead of writing ten lines of code, you can use a loop.

These are the basics of variables, if statements, else statements, and while loops in C. They help you create programs that can make decisions, store data, and repeat tasks, which are essential skills for programming
