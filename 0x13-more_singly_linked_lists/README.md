#C - More singly linked lists

let's imagine you have a bunch of boxes. Each box has something special inside it, and each box knows where the next box is. This way, if you want to find something, you just follow the boxes until you get to the right one.

Now, in a computer program, we use something similar called a linked list. Instead of boxes, we have something called nodes. Each node contains some information (like a number or a word) and a link to the next node.

So, let's say you have a list of numbers: 3 -> 7 -> 11 -> 5 -> 9. Each arrow represents a link from one node to the next.

Now, in the C programming language, we can create these linked lists using something called structs. A struct is like a template that describes what each node will look like.
