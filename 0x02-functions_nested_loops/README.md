#C Functions:
Think of a C function like a recipe in a cookbook. Each recipe has a name (like "Chocolate Chip Cookies"), a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions. In the world of programming, a function is like a recipe, and here's how it works:

Recipe Name: The name of the recipe (or function) describes what it does. For example, you can have a function called "MakeSandwich" or "CalculateAverage."

Ingredients: Just like a recipe needs ingredients, a function can take some information, called "parameters" or "arguments." If you're making a sandwich, the ingredients could be the type of bread, the filling, and so on. In programming, these ingredients are the values you give to the function to work with.

Instructions: The recipe contains step-by-step instructions. Similarly, a function has a set of instructions that perform a specific task. Once you follow these instructions, the function gives you a result, just like a recipe gives you a delicious meal.

Result: After following the instructions (or running the function), you get a result. For example, if you made a sandwich, your result is a tasty sandwich. In programming, the result could be a number, a piece of text, or whatever the function is designed to provide.

#Nested Loops:
Nested loops are like playing with building blocks. You have a big pile of blocks, and you want to arrange them in different ways. Here's how it works:

Outer Loop: Imagine you have a big box of building blocks, and you want to build something with it. The outer loop is like a big container that holds your blocks. It tells you how many times you want to repeat a certain action.

Inner Loop: Inside your container, you have a smaller container (the inner loop) that holds a different set of building blocks. This inner container repeats some actions a certain number of times before you move on to the next big container.

Repetition: The outer loop decides how many times you'll play with the inner loop. For example, if the outer loop says, "Do this five times," you'll have the inner loop do its thing five times before moving on.
