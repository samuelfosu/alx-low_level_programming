# Functions:

Think of a function like a recipe in a cookbook. A recipe tells you how to make a specific dish by following a set of instructions. In the same way, a function is like a set of instructions in a program that performs a specific task.

For example, let's say we have a function called "bake_cake." When you call this function, it follows a set of instructions to bake a cake. So, instead of writing the cake-baking instructions every time, you can just use the "bake_cake" function.

# Nested Loops:
Now, imagine you have a box of different toys, and you want to check each toy to see if it's broken. You might use a loop to go through each toy, right? A loop is like doing something repeatedly.

Nested loops are like having one loop inside another. Let's say you want to go through each box of toys, and for each box, you want to go through each toy inside. That's a nested loop â€“ a loop inside another loop.

So, in programming, nested loops help you do something repeatedly, and for each repetition, you do another set of repetitions.

To tie it all together, you might have a function called "check_all_toys" that uses nested loops. This function could go through each box of toys (outer loop) and, for each box, go through each toy inside (inner loop) to check if it's broken.

In summary, functions are like recipes that perform specific tasks, and nested loops help you repeat actions inside other actions, like going through each toy in each box.
