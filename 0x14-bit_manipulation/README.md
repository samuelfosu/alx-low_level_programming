#BIT MANIPULATION

Imagine you have a bunch of switches, each representing a single bit in a number. These switches can be either ON or OFF. Now, bit manipulation in C is like playing with these switches to perform various operations on numbers.

Here are some basic operations:

Setting a bit: If you want to turn a switch ON at a specific position, you would use the bitwise OR operator (|). It's like flipping the switch to ON without changing the other switches.

Clearing a bit: If you want to turn a switch OFF at a specific position, you would use the bitwise AND operator (&). It's like flipping the switch to OFF without changing the other switches.

Toggling a bit: If you want to change the state of a switch (from ON to OFF or vice versa) at a specific position, you would use the bitwise XOR operator (^). It's like flipping the switch to the opposite state without changing the other switches.

Checking a bit: If you want to see if a switch is ON or OFF at a specific position, you would use the bitwise AND operator (&). This will allow you to check whether a specific switch is ON or OFF without changing any switches.

Shifting bits: You can also shift all the switches to the left or right. It's like moving all the switches either to the left or right by a certain number of positions.

These operations are very useful in programming when you need to work with individual bits in numbers, like in cryptography, data compression, or low-level hardware manipulation.
