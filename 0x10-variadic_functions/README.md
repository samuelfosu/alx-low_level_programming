# C - Variadic functions


Variadic functions in C are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. These functions are useful when you need to create functions that can handle an arbitrary number of parameters. The most common variadic function in C is printf from the standard library, which can accept a variable number of arguments to format and print text.

To define a variadic function in C, you use the ellipsis (...) in the parameter list. The stdarg.h library provides macros and functions for working with variadic arguments.

# Include the necessary header file

 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <stdarg.h>

Define your variadic function. Use an ellipsis (...) to indicate that the function can accept a variable number of arguments.

# Call the variadic function with the desired number of arguments:

int result1 = add(3, 1, 2, 3);   // Result: 6
int result2 = add(4, 10, 20, 30, 40); // Result: 100

The count parameter is used to specify the number of additional arguments being passed to the function.

Variadic functions are powerful tools in C, but they come with some responsibilities, such as ensuring that you correctly handle the arguments and avoid runtime errors. When working with variadic functions, be careful with the argument count and types to prevent undefined behavior. Additionally, make sure to include proper error-checking mechanisms in your code to handle unexpected situations.
