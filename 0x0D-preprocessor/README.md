# C - Preprocessor

In C programming, the preprocessor is a part of the compiler that processes your source code before actual compilation. Its primary purpose is to perform text replacement and file inclusion to help simplify and organize your code, among other tasks. The preprocessor operates on lines that start with a # symbol, often referred to as "preprocessor directives."

Common preprocessor directives in C include:

#include: 
This directive is used to include external header files in your code.

#define: 

You can use this directive to create macros and constants. Macros are essentially text substitutions, and the preprocessor replaces the macro name with its defined value throughout your code.

#ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and #endif: 
These directives are used for conditional compilation. They allow you to include or exclude portions of your code based on preprocessor-defined conditions. You can define DEBUG with #define or by passing it as a command-line argument to the compiler.

#error and #pragma: 
These directives are used to generate errors or warnings during preprocessing, or to provide hints to the compiler, respectively. 

#undef: 
This directive is used to undefine macros or constants previously defined with #define.

#include (user-defined): 
You can include your own header files using #include. This allows you to split your code into multiple files for better organization and code reuse.

The preprocessor runs before the actual compilation process and prepares the code for compilation by performing these text manipulations and file inclusions. It helps in making code more modular, maintainable, and portable by allowing you to separate your program into reusable components and handle platform-specific or configuration-specific code variations.
