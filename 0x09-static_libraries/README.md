In C programming, a static library is a collection of object files (compiled code) that are combined into a single file. These object files typically contain functions, data, and other code that can be used by programs during compilation and linking. Static libraries are also known as "archive" files, and they have the file extension ".a" on Unix-like systems (e.g., libexample.a) or ".lib" on Windows systems (e.g., example.lib).
