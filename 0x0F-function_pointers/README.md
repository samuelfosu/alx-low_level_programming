# C - Function pointers

In C, function pointers are pointers that point to functions rather than data. They are a powerful and flexible feature that allows you to dynamically select and call functions at runtime. Function pointers are particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement callbacks, plugins, or design flexible, extensible code.

# Declaring a function pointer:
To declare a function pointer, you should match its signature with the function it will point to

# Assigning a function to a function pointer:
To make a function pointer point to a specific function, you can assign the function's name to the pointer.

# Calling a function through a function pointer:
You can call the function through the function pointer just like you would call the function directly, using the dereference operator *:

# Using function pointers for callbacks:
Function pointers are commonly used for callbacks, where a function accepts a function pointer as an argument. This allows you to pass a function that the called function can execute at a specific point.

Function pointers are a powerful tool in C, but they require careful use to avoid errors and maintain type safety. It's essential to ensure that the function pointer's signature matches the function it points to, or you can run into undefined behavior.
