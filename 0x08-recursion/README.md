#Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In C, as in many other programming languages, you can use recursion to implement algorithms and solve problems that can be naturally divided into smaller, similar subproblems.

Base Case: Every recursive function should have a base case, which is a condition that, when met, stops the recursion. Without a base case, the recursion would continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow. In the absence of a base case, you'd have an infinite recursion.

Recursive Case: In addition to the base case, there is the recursive case, where the function calls itself with a modified input. This is what makes the problem smaller with each recursive call.

Stack: In C, recursion uses the call stack to keep track of function calls. Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created, which includes the function's local variables and parameters. When a function returns, its stack frame is removed. If the recursion goes too deep without returning, you can run into a stack overflow error.

Memory Usage: Recursion can use a significant amount of memory if the recursion depth is large. This is because each function call creates a new stack frame. In some cases, you can optimize recursion into iteration to reduce memory usage.

Tail Recursion: In C, tail recursion is a special type of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation in the function. Tail-recursive functions can be optimized by the compiler to avoid creating new stack frames, potentially improving performance.

Indirect Recursion: Indirect recursion occurs when two or more functions call each other in a cycle. Care must be taken to avoid infinite loops in such cases.
