# C - Structures, typedef

In C programming, structures and typedef are two essential features that help you create custom data types and improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

# Structures:

A structure is a user-defined data type in C that allows you to group together variables of different data types under a single name. Each member of a structure can have a distinct data type, and the structure provides a way to represent complex data in a more organized and meaningful manner.

# Typedef:

typedef is a C keyword that allows you to create user-defined aliases for data types, including structures. It can make your code more readable and help abstract away implementation details. For example, you can use typedef to create aliases for structures:

typedef is especially useful when working with complex data structures, as it allows you to define custom types with meaningful names and hide the underlying implementation details.

Combining structures and typedef can lead to more intuitive and efficient code, as you can define complex data structures and then create variables of those types using simpler and more meaningful names.
